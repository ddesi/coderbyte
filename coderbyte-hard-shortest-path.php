//Have the function ShortestPath(strArr) take strArr which will be an array of strings which models a non-looping Graph. The structure of the array will be as follows: The first element in the array will be the number of nodes N (points) in the array as a string. The next N elements will be the nodes which can be anything (A, B, C .. Brick Street, Main Street .. etc.). Then after the Nth element, the rest of the elements in the array will be the connections between all of the nodes. They will look like this: (A-B, B-C .. Brick Street-Main Street .. etc.). Although, there may exist no connections at all. 

function ShortestPath($strArr) {
	
}
